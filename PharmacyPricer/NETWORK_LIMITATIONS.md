# Network Access Limitations

## Current Status
Both development and deployed environments appear to have restrictions on external network access, preventing direct connections to vendor portals like Kinray.com.

## Evidence
- `curl -I https://kinray.com` returns "Could not resolve host: kinray.com"
- Both NODE_ENV and REPLIT_DEPLOYMENT environment variables are empty
- Connection attempts timeout or fail with DNS resolution errors

## Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Proxy Service
Implement a proxy service that can handle external connections:
- Set up a separate service with unrestricted network access
- Route scraping requests through the proxy
- Maintain the existing scraping logic

### Option 2: API Integration
Instead of web scraping, integrate with vendor APIs:
- Kinray API (if available)
- Cardinal Health API
- McKesson API
- Use official data feeds rather than scraping

### Option 3: Manual Data Import
Create a system for manual data updates:
- CSV import functionality
- Scheduled data updates
- User-uploaded price files

### Option 4: Different Hosting Platform
Deploy to a platform with unrestricted network access:
- AWS/Google Cloud/Azure
- DigitalOcean
- Heroku
- VPS with full network capabilities

## Recommendation
Given the current constraints, Option 2 (API Integration) would be the most reliable long-term solution, followed by Option 4 (different hosting platform) for the web scraping approach.
